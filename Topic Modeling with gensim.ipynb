The data are defined at the national level only ‚Äì i.e. for the whole of Canada. These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\n\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt   \n",

       "5      The ‚ÄúLand Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000‚Äù is a thematic land cover classification representative of Circa 2000 conditions for agricultural regions of Canada. Land cover is derived from Landsat5-TM and/or 7-ETM+ multi-spectral imagery by inputting imagery and ground reference training data into a Decision-Tree or Supervised image classification process. Object segmentation, pixel filtering, and/or post editing is applied as part of the image classification. Mapping is corrected to the GeoBase Data Alignment Layer. National Road Network (1:50,000) features and other select existing land cover products are integrated into the product. UTM Zone mosaics are generated from individual 30 meter resolution classified scenes. A spatial index is available indicating the Land...   \n",

The data are defined at the national level only ‚Äì i.e. for the whole of Canada. These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\n\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt'"

       "\"The Pest Management Centre Minor Use Pesticides Program is a joint initiative between Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Health Canada‚Äôs Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) to improve the availability of reduced-risk products to agricultural producers and improve the access to a broad range of minor use pesticides. The PMC reviews the data resulting from field trials and laboratory analyses, and prepares a submission to PMRA to support the registration of the minor use pesticide. Upon receiving a finalized regulatory submission from PMC, PMRA reviews it and decides whether or not to accept the pesticide for use in Canada.\\n\\nThis list of submissions to PMRA is the result of PMC‚Äôs work and is for information purposes only. To find out if the pesticide can be used, please check with the pesticide manufacturer or visit PMRA's pesticide label database. \""
